 Fleet Fury is based on the classic tabletop game Battleships.

 In this version, the player enters their name and the amount of ships they would like to play with. 

 The position of the ships for both the player and the computer are randomly generated.

 The location of the ships are indicated by an @ sign, the location of the computer's ships are hidden and must be revealed by "shooting" at a location.

 The player enters the location that they would like to shoot by entering a number from 0 to 35.

 If the player hits a ship it is indicated by an X. if the player misses their shot it is indicated by a /.

 The player and computer take turns shooting untill one or the other has no more ships left. The participant who sinks all of their oponant's ships wins the game.
